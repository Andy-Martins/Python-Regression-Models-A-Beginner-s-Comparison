# Python Regression Models: A Beginner's Comparison

This project aims to compare the performance of three different regression models — Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Decision Tree Regressor — using the California Housing dataset. The goal is to practice regression techniques learned in a recent course and to provide an accessible learning resource for others.

## 📊 Overview

The project includes:
- Training and testing of three regression models.
- Evaluation of model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
- Simple code examples to help beginners understand how to implement these models in Python.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset used is the **California Housing dataset**, which is built-in to `scikit-learn`. It contains information on various housing attributes, such as median house value, median income, and population in different districts of California.

## 📋 Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- `scikit-learn` 
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these dependencies using:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib
